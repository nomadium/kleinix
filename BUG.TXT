vf2 notes

- it boots but...
- bug in kernel with cpu id == 1 (vf2 has 5 harts one is special)
- debug extension works but uart driver doesn't, it seems to hang or crash

How to boot?

load mmc 0:1 ${fdt_addr_r} jh7110-starfive-visionfive-2-v1.3b.dtb
load mmc 0:1 ${kernel_addr_r} efi/boot/bootriscv64.efi
bootefi ${kernel_addr_r} ${fdt_addr_r}
